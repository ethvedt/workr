# Workr

Workr is a simple productivity web app that allows you to collaborate with other users in teams and work on multiple projects. You can track individual tasks for each project and user. You can view your own tasks laid out on a calendar by due date. You can also see all of your projects, along with the next task due. There are two ways of viewing your projects, either in a table of all your projects, or sorted into tables for each team you are in.
